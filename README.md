## AX101 - Actyx Platform - Developer Fundamentals

The Actyx Platform - Developer Fundamentals course will get you up to speed building factory software applications on top af Actyx. These applications can run on edge devices on the shop floor and talk to each other using the local-first cooperation programming paradigm. While it does not teach advanced topics, you should be able to design, estimate and build simple Actyx solutions using the Actyx Pond framework after completing this course.

The course teaches basic skills from across the stack every developer working with Actyx should have. Future courses will allow you to specialize further into one or more specific roles.

* System Design and Architecture
* Data Modelling
* Backend Development
* Frontend Development
